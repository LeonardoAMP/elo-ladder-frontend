# Default Icon Placeholder

This folder should contain your character stock icons in PNG format.

File naming convention: `{icon_name}{skin}.png`

For example:
- `pikachu1.png` (Pikachu with skin 1)
- `mario2.png` (Mario with skin 2)
- `luigi1.png` (Luigi with skin 1)

Make sure to include a `default1.png` file as a fallback for missing icons.
